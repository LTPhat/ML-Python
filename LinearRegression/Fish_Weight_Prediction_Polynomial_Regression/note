* Load and read dataset.
* Cleaning data by domain knowledges or outlier detection (Preprocessing data before putting into model).
 - Outlier detection by Q3 - Q1 quantile equation. (Output values)
 - Outlier detection by checking independent variables outlier (Input values)
 - Remove outliers prior to specific outliers from input independent variables.
 - Convert categorical data (text) to numerical used for training model by one-hot encoding
    - Create one-hot encoding dataframe by pd.gets_dummmies function.
    - Remove one of k values that categorical data get to avoid Dummy Variables Trap.
    - Concatenate and complete the finish dataset to implement model
 * Training polynomial regression by numpy and scikitlearn with each (Compare)
 * Visualization
 * Training polynomial regression with all the independent variables inputs.
 * Output coef_,
 * Create dataframe for prediction from testset.
 * Model Evaluation.
