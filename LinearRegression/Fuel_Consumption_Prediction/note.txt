- Load and read dataset.
- Create dataframe (Panda)
- Visualize data (If necessary)
- Create training model (Recommend to split dataset in two seperate portion for training and testing to prevent overfitting and improve out of sample accuracy).
- Training
- Testing, compare to real value in given dataset.
- Calculate loss function value (MAE, MSE ...)
