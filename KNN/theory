  Step 1. The data were divided into a training sample set and a test sample set. The training sample set was A, A = {a1, a2, …, an}, the category of the sample is expressed as S, S = {W1, W2, …, Ws}, and the test sample set is X, X = {xj|j = 1, 2, …, n}.
 	Step 2. Set the initial k value as the initial nearest neighbor to X.
 	Step 3. Calculate the distance between the test sample points and all other training sample points.
 	Step 4. Sort the obtained distance in ascending order and select the appropriate k value.
 	Step 5. Select the closest k known samples.
 	Step 6. The category with the highest probability among k known samples was counted.
 	Step 7. Determine the category of test sample points as the category obtained by Statistics of Step 6.
